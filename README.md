## About Me
I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a strong foundation in mathematics, algorithms, and system design. My passion for programming began at a young age and has grown through both academic work and personal projects. I enjoy tackling complex computational problems and applying my skills to practical systems, from embedded devices to machine learning models.  

I am particularly interested in how numerical methods, optimization, and machine learning intersect to solve real-world challenges in engineering and computer science.
